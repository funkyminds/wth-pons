# wth-pons

#### This project is under heavy development.

[pons.eu](http://pons.eu/) based implementation for a translation service defined in [wth-core](https://github.com/funkyminds/wth-core) module.
It queries the pons REST API to get translation and parses json response to domain model.

The pons is an online multi-language dictionary and serves as a source for words definitions to be filled for flashcards.

More to come.
